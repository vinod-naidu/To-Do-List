📝 To-Do List App — Description
A To-Do List is a simple productivity app that helps users create, manage, and track tasks they need to complete. It allows users to add new tasks, view all tasks in a structured way, and remove tasks when they’re done. Some versions also support marking tasks as "completed."

🎯 Main Features:
✅ Add new tasks with a title or name

🗑️ Delete tasks when they’re no longer needed

🖥️ Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop

🗃️ Organized in table format with "Name" and "Delete" columns

Optional: Save tasks using localStorage, mark as complete, apply filters (e.g. show only incomplete)

🧱 Technologies Used:
HTML: To create the structure of the app (form, table, buttons)

CSS: To style the app and make it responsive using media queries

JavaScript: To add interactivity (adding, removing tasks dynamically)

📚 How It Works (Flow):
User enters a task name in the input box.

When the "Add Task" button is clicked:

The task is added as a new row in a table.

A delete button is included beside each task.

Clicking the ❌ button removes the task from the list.

💡 Real-Life Use Cases:
Daily task tracking (e.g., study schedule, shopping list)

Project task management

Homework or assignment checklist

Habit tracking

✅ Benefits of Making This Project:
Builds DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript

Teaches event handling, addEventListener, and createElement

Practice using HTML forms, tables, and responsive CSS

Prepares you for bigger frontend projects (like task managers, note apps, etc.)
